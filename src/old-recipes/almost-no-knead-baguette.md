*Original recipe from King Arthur Flour.*

## Ingredients

- 3 cups lukewarm water OR 4 c squash puree
- 8 cups King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
- 1 tablespoon table salt or 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon instant yeast

## Directions

### Make the Dough

1. Lightly grease a large bowel.
2. Add water.
3. Add dry ingredients and mix until there are no dry spots; the texture of the dough should be fairly soft.
4. Knead gently a few minutes by hand or 1 to 2 minutes in a stand mixer; it'll be very sticky.
5. Cover and let dough rest at room temperature for 2 hours.
6. Refrigerate overnight or up to 7 days.

### Bake the Bread

1. Scoop out 1 pound of dough (about a 1/4 of the batch) and place on a greased work surface.
2. Shape the dough into a rough, slightly flattened oval.
3. Fold the dough in half lengthwise and seal the edges with the heel of your hand.
4. Flatten slightly, fold lengthwise and seal again.
5. With the seam side down, cup your fingers and gently roll the dough into a 15-inch log.
6. Place the log seam-side down on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, or in a baguette pan.
7. Cover and let rise till very puffy, about 1 1/2 hours.
8. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 450Â°F.
9. Slash the baguette three or four times on the diagonal.
10. Spritz the baguette heavily with warm water.
11. Bake until a very deep golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool on a rack.
