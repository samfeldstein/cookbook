    ingredients:
      - Ground Beef – We use 1.5 lbs of 80/20 beef to make 4 double-patty burgers, but you can easily scale the recipe up to feed a crowd (use 3 lbs for 8 double-patty burgers).
      - Sauce – A simple combination of mayo and yellow mustard is what we use to grill and assemble the burgers.
      - Cheese – We love thick-sliced medium cheddar cheese for burgers, but you can use American-style cheese or your favorite sliced cheese.
  - section: Toppings
    ingredients:
      - Buns – Brioche buns taste great and have that steakhouse burger look, but any burger bun will work.
      - Lettuce – Thinly slice your iceberg lettuce for a restaurant-style smash burger.
      - Pickles – Sliced dill pickle chips are the best.
      - Tomatoes – Select meaty and large-sized tomatoes for burgers and cut them into rings.
      - Red onion – Thinly sliced into rings.
directions:
  - Prepare Patties. Divide 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef into 8 equal portions (3 oz
    each), cover, and refrigerate until ready to cook.
  - Make Sauce. Stir together 1/3 cup mayo and 1 tsp mustard and set aside.
  - Prep Toppings.
  - Toast buns. Lightly butter the cut side of your buns and toast on a griddle or skillet over medium heat until golden brown. Transfer to a rack.
  - Top buns. Place toppings on buns so you can add the burgers right from the grill.
  - Cook patties. Increase to medium-high heat. Depending on your surface area, place 2 to 4 cold pieces of meat onto the hot surface. Working quickly, cover each piece with a sheet of parchment paper and smash each into a thin patty. Remove parchment paper, season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, add a dab of sauce, and flip. Sear for 2 minutes on the first side and about a minute on the second side.
  - Add cheese. Place a slice of cheese onto half of the patties and top with a second patty and remove from heat. Serve warm over toasted buns with toppings.
