ingredients:
  - 2 Tbsp olive oil, divided
  - 2 cups diced ham or ham hock, (10 oz)
  - 1 medium onion, chopped
  - 2 celery stalks, finely chopped
  - 4 cups chicken stock
  - 8 cups water
  - 1 1/2 cups yellow dry split peas, rinsed and picked over (11-12 oz)
  - 2 sprigs of fresh thyme, or 1/4 tsp dried thyme leaves
  - 2 bay leaves
  - 5 medium Yukon or red potatoes, peeled and diced
  - 2 medium carrots, peeled and sliced into half rings
  - 1 1/2 tsp fine sea salt, divided, added to taste
  - 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
  - 3 garlic cloves
  - 2 Tbsp fresh dill or parsley, finely chopped

directions:
  - Set a large soup pot or 5 1/2 qt Dutch oven over medium-high heat and add 1
    Tbsp olive oil. Add ham (or ham hock, and sauté until golden brown). Remove
    ham to a separate plate.
  - Add 1 Tbsp olive oil and sauté onion and celery until softened, about 5
    minutes. Add stock, water, and drained peas, and add ham back to the pot.
    Bring to a boil and skim off any foam that rises to the top.
  - Add thyme and bay leaves and season with 1/2 tsp salt. Reduce heat to a
    simmer, partially cover and simmer for 1 hour 30 minutes or until peas are
    almost dissolved. If using a ham hock, remove bone from soup then shred the
    meat and put it back into the pot.
  - Add carrots and potatoes and cook another 20 minutes or until veggies are
    fork-tender.
  - Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove and discard the bay leaves and
    thyme stems.
  - Press in the garlic, add dill or parsley, then immediately turn off the
    heat. Serve topped with crispy bacon and more fresh herbs.
