ingredients:
  - 2 medium yellow onions, peeled, cut in half and sliced (~13 oz)
  - 2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breast, cubed
  - 1 medium red bell pepper, diced
  - 3 medium carrots, diced (5-6 oz)
  - 1 (15-oz) can tomato sauce
  - 1 (6-oz) can tomato paste
  - Juice of ½ lemon
  - 2 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger (~2-inch piece)
  - 3 tablespoons curry powder
  - 2 teaspoons garam masala
  - ½ teaspoon fine salt
  - 1 tablespoon salted butter, chilled and cut into pieces
  - ½ cup plain Greek yogurt (whole, low-fat, or fat-free)
  - ½ cup half-and-half

directions:
  - In the bottom of a 6-quart or 8-quart slow cooker, place and layer the
    sliced onions.
  - In a large bowl, combine the boneless chicken, bell pepper, carrots, tomato
    sauce, tomato paste, lemon juice, garlic, ginger, curry powder, garam
    masala, and salt. Toss until well combined.
  - Add the saucy chicken mixture to the slow cooker over top of the sliced
    onions.
  - Dot the pieces of butter over the top of the marinated chicken mixture.
  - Place the lid on the slow cooker and cook on high for 4 ½ hours or on low
    for 6 ½ hours.
  - After the time is up, remove the lid, stir all ingredients until well
    combined, and turn off the slow cooker.
  - When the liquid stops simmering and steaming (after about 5-10 minutes),
    stir in the yogurt and the half-and-half. If you stir in the yogurt and
    half-and-half before letting the mixture cool down a little, it could
    curdle.
  - Serve over hot cooked rice or cauliflower rice, and/or with naan bread, and
    garnish with chopped fresh cilantro and toasted sesame seeds.
