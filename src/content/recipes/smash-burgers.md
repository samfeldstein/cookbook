*Original recipe from [Natasha's Kitchen](https://natashaskitchen.com/smash-burger-recipe/).*

## Ingredients

- **Ground Beef** – We use 1.5 lbs of 80/20 beef to make 4 double-patty burgers, but you can easily scale the recipe up to feed a crowd (use 3 lbs for 8 double-patty burgers).
- **Sauce** – A simple combination of mayo and yellow mustard is what we use to grill and assemble the burgers.
- **Cheese** – we love thick-sliced medium cheddar cheese for burgers, but you can use American-style cheese or your favorite sliced cheese.

### Toppings

- **Buns** – brioche buns taste great and have that steakhouse burger look, but any burger bun will work
- **Lettuce** – thinly slice your iceberg lettuce for a restaurant-style smash burger
- **Pickles** – sliced dill pickle chips are the best
- **Tomatoes** – Select meaty and large-sized tomatoes for burgers and cut them into rings
- **Red onion** – thinly sliced into rings

## Directions

1. **Prepare Patties.** Divide 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef into 8 equal portions (3 oz each), cover, and refrigerate until ready to cook.
2. **Make Sauce.** Stir together 1/3 cup mayo and 1 tsp mustard and set aside.
3. **Prep Toppings.**
4. **Toast buns.** Lightly butter the cut side of your buns and toast on a griddle or skillet over medium heat until golden brown. Transfer to a rack.
5. **Top buns.** Place toppings on buns so you can add the burgers right from the grill.
6. **Cook patties.** Increase to medium-high heat. Depending on your surface area, place 2 to 4 cold pieces of meat onto the hot surface. Working quickly, cover each piece with a sheet of parchment paper and smash each into a thin patty. Remove parchment paper, season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, add a dab of sauce, and flip. Sear for 2 minutes on the first side and about a minute on the second side.
7. **Add cheese.** Place a slice of cheese onto half of the patties and top with a second patty and remove from heat. Serve warm over toasted buns with toppings.
