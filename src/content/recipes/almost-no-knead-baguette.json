          "Scoop out 1 pound of dough (about a 1/4 of the batch) and place on a greased work surface.",

          "With the seam side down, cup your fingers and gently roll the dough into a 15-inch log.",
          "Place the log seam-side down on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, or in a baguette pan.",
          "Cover and let rise till very puffy, about 1 1/2 hours.",
          "Towards the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 450Â°F.",
          "Slash the baguette three or four times on the diagonal.",
          "Spritz the baguette heavily with warm water.",
