      steps:
        - Combine all soup ingredients in a large pot.
        - Add 2 T sea salt.
        - Cover ingredients with 8 quarts water. Bring to a boil. (Takes at
          least 2 hours.)
        - Reduce heat to a simmer (around medium heat). Let the stock cook uncovered for 2-3 hours until the liquid reduces by a third and the stock is flavorful.
        - Remove everything except celery and carrots.
        - Add 2 T chopped dill. Adjust seasoning to taste, adding more sea salt if desired. Keep the stock warm till ready to serve.
        - Ladle the hot soup over the warm matzo balls.

      steps:
        - Whisk eggs with vegetable oil and seltzer water.
        - Stir in everything up to dill.
        - Chill in fridge 30 minutes.
        - Combine 6 quarts water with 2 pinches saffron and 2 T sea salt.
        - Bring to a simmer, stir to dissolve the salt. Keep hot until the matzo ball mixture is fully chilled.
        - Place a small dish of cold water beside the pot of saffron water.
        - Take batter out of fridge. Wet your hands and roll the matzo ball batter into walnut-sized balls, then gently drop them into the simmering water.
        - When all of the matzo balls are in the water, bring back to a low bubbling simmer (not a heavy boil) and cover the pot.
        - Simmer for 30-35 minutes.
        - When fully cooked, turn off the heat and keep the matzo balls in the hot saffron water until ready to serve. (If you won’t be serving within an hour, remove the matzo balls from the pot with a slotted spoon and reserve so they don’t get mushy and fall apart.)
