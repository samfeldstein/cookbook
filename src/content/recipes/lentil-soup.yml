ingredients:
  - 1 ½ tablespoon olive oil
  - 1 large red onion, diced
  - 4 stalks celery, diced
  - 1 large carrot, diced, or two medium size carrots
  - 5 cloves garlic, minced
  - 26 ounces fresh tomatoes, chopped – you can also use a 28oz can diced tomatoes and drain the liquid
  - 1 cup dried brown lentils, picked over, rinsed and dried
  - 1 tablespoon garam masala
  - salt & pepper to taste
  - 6 cups vegetable broth
  - 2-3 sprigs thyme, to be removed at the end
  - 1 cup kale, roughly chopped
  - 2 tablespoons lime
  - "Toppings, optional: Oil drizzle, red wine vinegar, red pepper flakes, parsley, and/or sprinkle of zaatar crusty bread"

directions:
  - In a large, deep pot over medium high heat, add the olive oil to heat.
  - Add the onions, celery, carrot and minced garlic. Stir together and allow to sweat for about 8 minutes, to soften and release natural juices from the veggies.
  - Add in the tomatoes, brown lentils, garam masala and salt and pepper. Stir together. Pour in the vegetable broth, and add the thyme and stir again.
  - Bring to a boil, and then to a simmer for 30 minutes, until lentils are fully cooked.
  - Remove the thyme. Scoop out two cups of soup (with liquid) and pour into your blender. If you have a glass blender, ensure it cools down a bit first!
  - Press the soup setting or blend until fully blended out. Pour back into soup pot and mix the soup together one more time to combine everything.
  - Add in kale and lime juice and stir to combine.
  - Serve the soup and top with your favourite toppings and enjoy!
