Hi. I thought it'd be nice to have a website where we collect family updates, history, and recipes. As you can see, this is a very barebones operation at the moment, but I figured it was best to just get it up and running. Everything else in time.

## Ideas for the site

- Recipes (already implemented)
- Family history (documents, photos, write-ups, articles)
- People (a little info on who everybody is/was, contact info, city of residence)
- Updates (family can share announcements, year-end letters, etc.)

## Privacy concerns

I can probably figure out how to put the website behind a login page, and I can stop it from showing up in search engines. But it's still on the internet, so until I learn more about cybersecurity, the only materials that should be posted to the site are those we are comfortable sharing with the public.

If people have ideas or thoughts about this, I'd love to hear them.

## Send me things

Please [email me](mailto:sam@samfeldstein.xyz) any materials you think should go on the site. And let me know if you have thoughts, ideas, or feedback.

Thanks all!

Sam
